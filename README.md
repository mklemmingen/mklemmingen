### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a beastly hanging man computer for a class project and in my spare time I am trying to create a long-range LoRaWAN rescue device for the organisation of rural Mass-Casualty-Patients using low-cost modules and open-source forks.

- Hanging Man (Public repo) -> game construct finished, now interface building
- LoRaWAN organizational medical devices (private repo as of 15.May 23) -> module set, working on long range bandwith improvement and secure RFID authentification 
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C - trying to refresh my R and SQL - and to understand unix-based servers

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: send a message to: MKL7543@duck.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/they

- Fun Fact: Next to my studies and private projects, I work with handicapped adults to accompany and to educate them into becoming more independent
